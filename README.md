# Tic Tac Toe : AI Challenge

A Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with a GUI built using Java Swing and an AI opponent.

### Game Rules
* The game is played on a 3x3 grid
* Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on the grid
* The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game
* If all of the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw

### Features
* The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to choose the best move

### Future Improvements
* Allow players to choose their own names and assign them different colors or symbols for their moves
* Add an option for players to choose the size of the board (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, 5x5)

### Built With
* Java - The programming language used
* Java Swing - The GUI framework used

### Bugs 
* Feel free to report bugs, either in code itself or in algorithm.
